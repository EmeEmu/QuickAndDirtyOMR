Quick & Dirty OMR is a webpage containing a simple linear grating stimulation for evoking the [OptoMotor Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optomotor_response).  
It was designed with zebrafish larve in mind, so that a petri dish could be placed on the screen of a laptop or smartphone.
The website is far from perfect, and is still in development.
